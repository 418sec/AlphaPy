Market Prediction Tutorial
==========================

From the ``examples`` directory, run the following commands::

    cd "Trading Model"
    marketstream -d './config'
    jupyter notebook

.. note:: Note that you can work entirely within a Jupyter
   notebook, or solely from the command line. Generally, we like
   to run the pipelines first and then perform our analysis within
   a notebook.
