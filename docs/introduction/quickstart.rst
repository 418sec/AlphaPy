Quick Start
===========

Install the ``alphapy`` package::

    pip install alphapy

.. note:: Please refer to :doc:`install` for further details.

From your command line application, clone the repository::

    git clone https://github.com/Alpha314/AlphaPy

Change your directory to the examples location::
  
    cd alphapy/examples

Currently, there are four examples, two of which you run from
the command line and the other two in a Jupyter Notebook:

* :doc:`../tutorials/kaggle`
* :doc:`../tutorials/ncaab`
* :doc:`../tutorials/market`
* :doc:`../tutorials/system`
